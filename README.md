### Lab 1
* initialize a variable and change its value in a function by reference
* implement insertion sort for arrays of int

### Lab 2
* implement linked lists using structs
* using unions in linked lists for data type flexibility

### Lab 3
* implement a version of strcat()
* implement a version of strcmp()
* implement a version of atoi(), convert from string to integer
* detect cycles in a linked list data structure using a simplified version of Floyd's tortoise and hare cycle-finding algorithm.




### Project 1
* reading data from a text file
* sorting arrays of structs by alphabetic data members
*
