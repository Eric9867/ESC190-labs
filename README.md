# ESC190-labs
_Eric Lefort, Halil Kelebek_

### Lab 1
* initialize a variable and change its value in a function by reference
* implement insertion sort for arrays of int

### Lab 2
* implement linked lists using structs
* using unions in linked lists for data type flexibility

### Lab 3
* implement a version of strcat()
* implement a version of strcmp()
* implement a version of atoi(), convert from string to integer
* detect cycles in a linked list data structure using a simplified version of Floyd's tortoise and hare cycle-finding algorithm.

### Lab 4
* operating on linked lists
	* free
	* append
	* insert
	* delete
	* print
* locating index of element in sorted list in logarithmic time


### Project 1: _autocomplete_
* reading data from a text file
* sorting arrays of structs using different types of comparisons (qsort)
* binary search: locating indices of elements in a sorted list in logarithmic time ... again
